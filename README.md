## What's Included?

### Grunt

Grunt is a JavaScript task runner to automate common actions. The Tagged NPM Package Seed
supports the following built-in grunt tasks:

**test**

Runs all unit tests through mocha.

    $ grunt test

**coverage**

Runs all unit tests and generates a code coverage report in `./test/coverage.html`

    $ grunt coverage

**watch**

Automatically runs mocha tests each time a file changes in `./lib` or `./test`.

    $ grunt watch

**docs**

Generates documentation for all JS files within `./lib` using docco. Documentation is
written to `./docs`.

    $ grunt docs

**clean**

Deletes all auto-generated files, including `./docs` and `./test/coverage.html`

### Mocha, Sinon, Chai, Blanket

The ultimate TDD environment for node. Place your specs in `./test/lib`, and run `grunt test`
to run them.

See `./test/lib/index_test.js` for examples.
